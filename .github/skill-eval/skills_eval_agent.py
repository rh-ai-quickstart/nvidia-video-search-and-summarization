"""Skills eval agent — single-shot CI-driven runner.

Called by .github/workflows/skills-eval.yml on push to `pull-request/<N>`
when files under `skills/` (or the harness itself) change. Spawns one
`claude-agent-sdk` agent with `.github/skill-eval/AGENTS.md` as its
system prompt and lets it drive the eval end-to-end: diff →
adapter/dataset → Brev lock → harbor run → results comment → cleanup.

The agent gets Bash/Read/Edit/Write/Glob/Grep. It is explicitly told
(in AGENTS.md) that it must NOT modify anything under `skills/`.

Env (set by the workflow step):
    PR_NUMBER             PR being evaluated, e.g. "100" (push mode; blank on workflow_dispatch)
    PR_BASE               Base branch, e.g. "develop" (push mode; blank on workflow_dispatch)
    PR_HEAD_SHA           Mirror or main-branch head SHA (full)
    PR_REPO               "owner/repo"
    GITHUB_RUN_ID         CI run id (for lock + instance-started tracking)
    GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY   Path to a markdown file appended to the Actions run summary
                          page. The agent writes per-spec results tables here in
                          manual-sweep mode (no PR to comment on).
    MANUAL_FULL_SWEEP     "1" when workflow_dispatch fired. Swaps user prompt:
                          enumerate every skills/<skill>/eval/*.json for the
                          skill named in MANUAL_SKILLS_FILTER (or all skills when
                          `*`), write results to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, never
                          post `gh pr comment`, never raise bot PRs (missing
                          adapter is a BLOCKED outcome). Every spec on the
                          chosen skill(s) runs — no spec-level filter knob.
    MANUAL_SKILLS_FILTER  Single skill name from the dispatch dropdown, or "*"
                          for all (default "*"). Validated server-side by GH
                          Actions against the type:choice enum.
    ANTHROPIC_*           Agent SDK credentials (sourced from coordinator .env)
    GH_TOKEN              PR comment posting (push mode only)
    NGC_CLI_API_KEY       Local NIM pulls in trials
    LLM_REMOTE_URL        Optional; enables remote-* deploy modes
    VLM_REMOTE_URL        Optional; enables remote-* deploy modes
    BREV_ENV_ID           Set by Brev on the coordinator host; part of secure-link URLs

Exit codes:
    0 - agent completed (eval may still report failures in PR comment)
    1 - setup error (missing env, AGENTS.md not found, sdk install failed)
    2 - agent crashed
    3 - agent hit max_turns without finishing

**Manual full-sweep run** — `workflow_dispatch` fired (no PR, no diff).

Context:
  repo                = {pr_repo}
  head SHA            = {pr_head}
  workflow run        = {run_id}

  skills filter       = {skills_filter}   (single skill name from the dispatch dropdown, or `*` = all)
  GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY = {step_summary or '(unset — fall back to stdout)'}

Per AGENTS.md § "Manual full-sweep mode" — overrides apply to steps 1, 3, 6:

  Step 1 (override): skip the diff entirely. Enumerate `skills/*/eval/*.json`
    on the checked-out workspace. Keep only the skill named in `skills filter`
    (the dispatch dropdown is single-select; `*` matches all). All specs on the
    chosen skill(s) run — there is no spec-level filter. Skills with no eval/
    dir are runtime libraries and are skipped as in the normal path.

  Step 3 (override): the bot-PR flow is OFF in manual mode (there's no
    contributor branch to target). If an adapter is missing or stale for a
    spec, record that spec as BLOCKED with the trigger that fired
    (missing / stale / spec drift) and a one-line reason in the results
    table — DO NOT push a branch, DO NOT create a PR. Keep processing the
    remaining (skill, spec) pairs.

  Step 6 (override): there is no PR to comment on. For each completed
    `(skill, spec)` batch, append the same markdown table you would have
    posted via `gh pr comment` to the path in `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Use:

      cat >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY" <<'MD'
      ## Harbor Eval — `skills/<skill>/eval/<spec>.json`
      ... (table + failing checks + suggestions, identical to § Result comment format) ...
      MD

    Append per-spec — don't buffer everything for the end. If
    `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is empty/unset (smoke-test locally), print the
    same markdown to stdout instead and note the fallback.

Everything else in AGENTS.md applies unchanged: startup hygiene, fleet
selection (§ 5a), per-box flock (§ 5b), canonical harbor invocation, no
trial-supervision polling, no writes under `skills/`, no instance lifecycle
calls.

When done, emit `DONE: <n>/<total> specs passed; <m> blockers` on the final
line. If the sweep couldn't proceed at all (e.g. pool exhausted before the
first trial), emit `BLOCKED: <reason>` instead.
